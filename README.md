# Criminal Commitments Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis of criminal commitments data, examining patterns in offenses, sentencing, time served, enhancements, and recidivism.

## Project Overview

This project contains two analyses:

### 1. Prior Commitments Analysis
Analysis of historical criminal commitments including:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Categorical Analysis (offense types, relationships)
- Time-Based Analysis (time served calculations)
- Statistical Tests (Chi-square, t-tests, correlation, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Recidivism Analysis

### 2. Current Commitments Analysis
Analysis of current criminal commitments including:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Categorical Analysis
- Time-Based Analysis
- **Enhancement Analysis** (sentence enhancements)
- Statistical Tests (Chi-square, t-tests, correlation, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Current Commitment Patterns

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd prior_commitments_analysis
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your Data

- `prior_commitments.csv` is included in the repo
- **Add `currentcommits.xlsx` manually** to the `data/` folder (file too large for GitHub)

### 5. Run the Notebooks

```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Navigate to notebooks/ folder and open desired notebook
```
